# School_District_Analysis

Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze schools and their student population to better understand how to improve the school facilities for the respective student populace. The analysis was done based on test results of the students and the budget for each school. Some parameters for the school dataset was type of school such as public or charter, number of students, budget and the name of the school. The student data set had student names, gender, grade enrolled and test scores. 39000 students from 15 different were examined to determine if the respective scholl was being allocated the correct budget.

Results

How is district summary affected? 
  
  Math and reading scores as well as the pass rate  were not significantly statisitcally impacted as the as the ninth grades had a normal population spread so the overall impact was minimal in the overall assesment of the data set. 

How is school summary affected?

  The school summary was the same except for Thomas High School were the 9th grade student population was taken out, this dropped the pass rate since the 9th grade     population was a statistiscal significant proportion of Thomas High School student population. 
  
How does replacing the ninth grade scores affect the following:

  Math and Reading scores by grade?
      Removing the 9th grade THS class impacted the overall pass rate for the 9th grade class by dropping the pass rate but the other grades were not impacted.
      
  Scores by school spending?
     The impact from removing the 9th grade class scores gave the optics that the school was getting less of a return on preformance for students per dollars since the students scores were just removed but not removing the student impact on the budget.
  
  Scores by school size?
      There was no impact by school size since the scores were only removed not the students themselves. 
      
  Scores by school type?
      There was no impact by school type since the scores were only removed not the students themselves.
      
Summary

The overall scores and pass rates accross all schools and students aggregated did not change significantly after removing the THE 9th grade class. Drilling down further to just THS though one can observe the 9th grade class buffed the stats of the school, once the 9th grade class was removed math and reading pass rates dropped equally by 25% and the students at THS that passed both math and reading dropped by a third. Before removing THS's 9th grade class they were a top 3 school after removing that class THS fell to the bottom half of the schools examined. One other obsrvation of this data set is the charter schools were significantly ahead of the public schools in overall pass rate. This suggests charter schools may have a better efficency of allocating budget and quality of education to prepare students to scores higher on the tests.
